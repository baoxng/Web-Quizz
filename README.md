# Web-Quizz

## Project description
This is a project to quiz user on their knowledge of javascript. I have a series of four questions. When user click start button, they are directed to the start of the quiz page. After clicking the first answer to the question a timer is started. This timer will stop once it hits zero, but each time user answer's incorrectly then timer will decrement by 10. At the end of the quiz, user could submit their name and this will be saved on the local storage.

## Development
The difficuty of this project was spending long hours trying to trouble shoot some errors and writing functions that would work or would display onto the html. Most of my time spent was relearning how to write functions and making me more confused about it the longer I stared the screen. I wrote the basic things that were need at first. Then I tried looking at youtube tutorials and matching some functions to my own, and a lot of it just didn't make sense. This is still something I will come back to, to fix my errors and rewriting javascript codes. This was overall very challenging and definitely needs more work.
